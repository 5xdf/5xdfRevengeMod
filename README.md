# Revenge

A modification for the Discord Android app. Continuation of [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod). Get it? Vendetta is like, revenging..., yeah.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing

> [!NOTE]  
> While [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod) used to be platform-agnostic, Revenge will only focus on Android as alternatives exist for iOS.  
> Focusig on just Android gives us more benefit, as we can add Android-only features more easily.

Installing is not currently possible yet, as we're on the process of moving and renaming things.

## üíñ Contributing

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project now uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) instead of Node.js.  
> It is **recommended** to use Bun over Node.js because Bun is faster and far better for development.  
>
> If you're on Windows, we recommend checking out WSL.

This section will be worked on once the [**‚¨áÔ∏è Installing**](#%EF%B8%8F-installing) section is finished.

<!-- 1. Install a Vendetta loader with loader config support (any mentioned in the [Installing](#installing) section).

1. Go to Settings > General and enable Developer Settings.

2. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    bun i
    ```

4. Build Vendetta's code:
    ```
    bun run build
    ```

5. In the newly created `dist` directory, run a HTTP server. We recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

6. Go to Settings > Developer enabled earlier). Enable `Load from custom url` and input the IP address and port of the server (e.g.  e.g. `http://192.168.1.236:4040`) in the new input box labelled `VENDETTA URL`.

7. Restart Discord. Upon reload, you should notice that your device will download Vendetta's bundled code from your server, rather than GitHub.

8. Make your changes, rebuild, reload, go wild! -->
