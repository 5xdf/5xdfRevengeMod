# Revenge

A modification for the Discord Android app. Get it? Vendetta is like, revenging..., yeah.

## ⬇️ Installing

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> While Vendetta used to be platform-agnostic, Revenge will only focus on Android as alternatives exist for iOS.  

Installing is not currently possible yet, as we're on the process of moving and renaming things.

This section will be worked on once the [**⬇️ Installing**](#%EF%B8%8F-installing) section is finished.

<!-- 1. Install a Vendetta loader with loader config support (any mentioned in the [Installing](#installing) section).

2. Go to Settings > General and enable Developer Settings.

3. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```
    bun i
    ```

5. Build Vendetta's code:
    ```
    bun run build
    ```

6. In the newly created `dist` directory, run a HTTP server. We recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

7. Go to Settings > Developer enabled earlier). Enable `Load from custom url` and input the IP address and port of the server (e.g.  e.g. `http://192.168.1.236:4040`) in the new input box labelled `VENDETTA URL`.

8. Restart Discord. Upon reload, you should notice that your device will download Vendetta's bundled code from your server, rather than GitHub.

9. Make your changes, rebuild, reload, go wild! -->
